# Remarkable-highlights

As I started to read more books in foreign languages, the process of translating every phrase I did not understand became prevalent and very tedious.  
Fortunately Remarkable 2 provides ssh access to the device - making it easy to synchronize highlights data with any pc.  

When a new highlight is detected, the highlighted text gets translated with help of DeepL API.
